# Hello!

> "You can learn anything if you just Try. Error. Document."

Welcome to the place where I yap about my current projects, concepts and ideas.

If you're interested in:
- Language development
- Graphics/GPU programming
- Game development
- The Rust programming language
- Discord bots
- Rust UI ecosystem
- Web assembly

Then you might find some of my articles (monologues, if you prefer) interesting!

The goal with this blog is to document my learning journey, from my research into new topics, deep dives into various software domains or reflection on the shortcomings and pain points of completed projects.

## About me

I go by the online pseudonym Shuppin, in the real world I'm a software engineer with an ever lasting goal to achieve technical mastery in anything and everything I find interesting. 

My philosophy is that any code is good code, so long as you've learnt something by writing it. I've got many failed projects to my name, but in each and everyone one of them I've learnt so many new concepts, skills and techniques in doing these projects that it doesn't matter. If you're learning to code, please please please I urge you to just try! Any idea that pops into your head, just try it! With enough commitment, you will be able to do it.

My favourite programming language is Rust, because I like writing the code that just worksâ„¢. Nah, I'm kidding almost all of my code is broken ðŸ˜¢ (but that code is private so no one will ever know).
